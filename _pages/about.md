When I first started mathematics(especially vector calculus), I was fascinated with its versatility.
It can solve what happens to the object without conducting any experiments, such as how a material deforms over time.
At first, I enjoyed tinkering equations and plotting the result. But it became dull. I wanted to visualize mathematical expressions more *aesthetically*. That's why I jumped into the field of computer graphics. Currently, I'm devoting most of my time to studying calculus and physics.

I hope you enjoy the articles.
